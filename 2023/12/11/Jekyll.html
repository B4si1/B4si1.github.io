<h1>Jekyll</h1>
<p>Jekyll is a popular static site generator designed for creating simple, fast, and secure websites. It allows users to build websites by converting plain text files (often in Markdown, Liquid, HTML, or other templating languages) into static websites.</p>

<p>Developed in Ruby, Jekyll simplifies the process of website development by eliminating the need for databases and server-side scripting. It operates by taking content, processing it through templates, and generating a complete website that consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.</p>

<p>One of Jekyll’s key features is its flexibility and ease of use, offering a straightforward directory structure and the ability to customize layouts, themes, and plugins. It’s known for its support of GitHub Pages, where users can host their Jekyll-powered sites for free.</p>

<p>By generating static websites, Jekyll produces sites that are fast, secure, and easy to host on various platforms. It’s particularly favored among developers who prefer simplicity, version control, and a straightforward workflow in building websites or blogs.</p>
