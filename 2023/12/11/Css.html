<p>CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a fundamental component of web design and development. It is a styling language used to describe the presentation and layout of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language) documents, defining how elements are displayed on webpages.</p>

<p>CSS enables web developers to control the visual aspects of a webpage, such as the fonts, colors, spacing, layout, and overall appearance. By separating the content (HTML) from its presentation (CSS), it allows for greater flexibility and efficiency in managing the design of websites and applications.</p>

<p>This styling language works by applying style rules to HTML elements, using selectors to target specific elements and declarations to define how those elements should look. It offers a wide range of properties and values that can be manipulated to achieve various visual effects, ensuring consistency and aesthetic appeal across different devices and screen sizes.</p>

<p>With CSS, designers can create responsive and visually appealing web layouts, enhance user experience, and customize the look and feel of a website, making it a powerful tool in modern web development.</p>
