<p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a task without being explicitly programmed. It is based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns, make decisions, and improve over time with minimal human intervention.</p>

<p>The primary goal of machine learning is to allow computers to learn automatically from past data or experiences to perform specific tasks more accurately, such as prediction, classification, clustering, and pattern recognition. It operates by using various techniques and algorithms that enable machines to recognize patterns and make decisions or predictions based on new input data.</p>

<p>Machine learning models can be categorized into three main types:</p>

<p>Supervised learning: This involves training a model on labeled data, where the algorithm learns from input-output pairs. The model can make predictions or decisions when given new, unseen data based on the patterns it learned during training.</p>

<p>Unsupervised learning: In this type, the model is given unlabeled data and tasked with finding hidden patterns or structures within the data. Clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association are common tasks performed through unsupervised learning.</p>

<p>Reinforcement learning: This learning paradigm involves an agent learning to make decisions by interacting with an environment. It receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, enabling it to learn the best strategies or actions to maximize cumulative reward over time.</p>

<p>Machine learning finds applications in various fields, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, healthcare, finance, autonomous vehicles, and many others, due to its ability to analyze large volumes of data, extract insights, and make predictions or decisions.</p>
